Hi! 👋 I’m a passionate Full Stack Development (FSD) learner on a dedicated journey to becoming a skilled web developer. I am currently focused on mastering HTML and CSS, building a strong and reliable foundation for creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I enjoy transforming ideas and designs into clean, well-structured web pages that follow best practices and web standards.

To get started with real-world development, I have also built small beginner-friendly projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects help me understand core concepts such as layouts, styling, basic interactivity, and problem-solving through code. They represent my first steps into frontend development and continuous learning.

Through consistent practice and hands-on experimentation, I am improving my understanding of responsive design, accessibility, and visual consistency. This GitHub profile documents my learning journey, showcasing my practice work, mini-projects, and progress over time.

My long-term goal as an FSD learner is to expand into advanced JavaScript, frameworks, backend technologies, and databases to build complete, end-to-end web applications. I’m always eager to learn, improve, and collaborate with others in the developer community. 🚀
